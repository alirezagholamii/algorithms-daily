## Introduction

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fâ‚™, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, and for n > 1.

The sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

 Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
